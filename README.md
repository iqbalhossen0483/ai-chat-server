# AI Chat App Backend Documentation

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**  
  A powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building scalable, high-performance backend applications. Node.js allows for asynchronous, event-driven programming, making it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like real-time chat.

- **Express.js**  
  A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs. It simplifies the routing and middleware management of HTTP requests, ensuring smooth and efficient communication between the client and server.

- **Mongoose**  
  An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, used to model and interact with the application's data. Mongoose provides a straightforward API for data validation, schema definitions, and CRUD operations, helping streamline interactions with the MongoDB database.

- **Google Generative AI**  
  A cutting-edge AI model powered by Googleâ€™s advanced machine learning infrastructure. It is designed for generating human-like responses in natural language, making it ideal for building intelligent and context-aware chatbots capable of engaging in meaningful conversations with users.

- **HTTP Streaming**  
  A method of communication that enables real-time, bidirectional data exchange between the server and the client. Using the HTTP streaming technique, the server can continuously push updates to the client, creating a seamless, live interaction experience in the chat app without requiring the user to refresh the page.
